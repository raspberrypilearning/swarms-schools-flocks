## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add some sound or graphic effects to your project, to customise it.
- Add a timer to your project, so that after a minute the game ends, and the score is displayed
- Add a variable to store the number of clones at the start, that reduces each time one is eaten, so the game ends when there are no more clones.
- Make your clones uneatable when they reach a certain size.

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.
